<p>Trace the constituent shapes of a mandala one by one. Take your time. Listen to the sand dropping. Absorb the generative soundtrack. Then when the mandala is done, shake the device to erase it. Over 14k downloads. Used at home and in temples around the world.</p>

<p>With this iPad experience, I wanted to capture some of the tactility and ritual involved in the creation of sand mandalas. Produced in one weekend as part of <a href="http://www.tigsource.com/2010/08/31/tigjam-3/" target="_blank">TIGJam 3</a>.</p>

<p>And now it's open source on <a href="https://github.com/dongle/Yantra-Mandala" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
