<p>Privilege is an activity in the form of a card game to facilitate conversations about privilege in general as well as the specific privileges that each participant brings to the table.</p>

<p>The central mechanic is that each player creates rules based on privileges they possess but that other players do not. This forces players to recognize their own advantages as well as others' disadvantages. This results in players leaving each other out. It's an uncomfortable situation; a condensed version of the sort of exclusion that occurs in the everyday.</p>

<p>The activity was created for and tested at The Point, a nonprofit organization in the Bronx, NY dedicated to youth development. "Privilege" could be used in workplaces, events (ice-breakers), learning environments (cultural centers, schools), or among various groups within a community (e.g., policemen and citizens).

<p>Privilege was developed with Jonathan Beilin, Tevin Byrd, and Shakti Mb.</p>
