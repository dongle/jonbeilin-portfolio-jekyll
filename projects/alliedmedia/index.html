<p>The <a href="http://amc.alliedmedia.org/" target="_blank">Allied Media Conference</a> is a yearly get-together focusing on developing media based strategies for social justice organizing. For the games-oriented track "Building Better Futures Through Play", I reached out to potential speakers and workshops, organized fundraising, secured space, and other general conference logistics. We work both to discuss how interactive media can be used for outreach and to teach real skills to encourage underrepresented voices to make games.</p>
