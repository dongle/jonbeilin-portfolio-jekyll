<p>The <a href="http://amc.alliedmedia.org/" target="_blank">Allied Media Conference</a> is a yearly get-together focusing on developing media based strategies for social justice organizing. For the games-oriented track "Building Better Futures Through Play", I reached out to potential speakers, organized fundraising, secured space, and other general conference logistics.</p>
