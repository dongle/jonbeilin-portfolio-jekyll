	<p>The <a href="http://amc.alliedmedia.org/" target="_blank">Allied Media Conference</a> is a yearly get-together focusing on developing media strategies for social justice. For the games-oriented track "Imagining Better Futures Through Play", I reached out to potential speakers, organized fundraising, and worked on the general logistics of a conference.</p>
