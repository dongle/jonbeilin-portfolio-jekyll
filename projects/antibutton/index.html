<p>Materials: Arduino + clamp</p>
<p>The ease of use of consumer technology – both cognitive and physical – allows for unhealthy usage patterns. Coupled with the metered dopamine squirts administered and optimized in the addictive design of many websites and videogames, people can get locked into negative usage patterns. 

One definition of technology is that it is anything that amplifies effort. Tap a finger to a screen and so much can happen: a mighty plumber's leap, a furious bird's nosedive. With the typical button, a light press registers input to trigger dramatic action. This button is antagonistic: the closed clamp results in a closed circuit, constantly registering a given input unless a large amount of effort is expended to hold it open, thus breaking the circuit. Designed for one-button games such as <a href="www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/" target="_blank">Canabalt</a>.</p>
