<p>Materials: Arduino + clamp</p>
<p>The ease of use of consumer technology – both cognitive and physical – allows for unhealthy usage patterns. Coupled with the metered dopamine squirts administered by certain types of websites and videogames, people can get locked into addictive patterns. At its core, technology is anything that amplifies effort. Tap a finger to a screen and so much can happen. I wanted to invert the typical button, where a light press registers input, to make it antagonistic where it'll constantly register an input unless a large amount of effort is expended. Thus the clamp – keep it open to break the circuit, then let it close to complete the circuit and create input. Designed for one-button games such as <a href="www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/" target="_blank">Canabalt</a>.</p>
