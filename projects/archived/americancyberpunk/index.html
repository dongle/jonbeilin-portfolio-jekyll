<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>American Cyberpunk is a documentary about self-empowerment. It is about how anyone, even with scarce resources, even without a technical background, can make large differences in their communities by using technology and media in new ways.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>The narrative around personal computing technology has become increasingly consumerist and aligned with capitalism. And it is leaving many people behind – although more people have smartphones than ever, there are entire urban communities in America without even in-home internet access. Fortunately, the amplifying power of technology works both ways, and grass-roots organizations are springing up and using every day object (eg, routers, cheap camcorders and phone-cameras) to provide infrastructure and media for their communities, subverting the corporations that are willfully disenfranchising them.</p>

<p>These activists mirror some of the concepts and actions of the 80s sci-fi genre of cyberpunk, a genre developed by a diverse group of radical authors as a counterpoint to the jingoist/fascist mainstream sci-fi. And that’s no surprise – these activists read Gibson and Acker and LeGuin. Now, with the rising interest in cyberpunk in a post-Snowden world, I will employ the genre to frame and magnify these stories of underserved communities of color re-appropriating consumer technology to solve problems in their communities. Each story will open with an interview with a classic cyberpunk author discussing how they personally envisioned technology being used for liberatory/subversive purposes, followed by people doing that in real life, on the ground. Proposed chapters: William Gibson discussing mass media, followed by Phillycam, a group of people in Philadelphia creating their alternative to the racist local news using consumer-grade cameras and livestreaming websites; Gareth Branwyn talking about the internet, followed by the Detroit Digital Justice coalition about creating a free urban wifi network to bring all of Detroit online.</p>

<p>Using technology should not be only for the privileged, and it is not just for building silly apps. My hope is that viewers of this film will find that they identify with some of the characters and want to start attacking real social problems with technology.</p>
