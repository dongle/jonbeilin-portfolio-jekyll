<p>During GDC 2014, I grew tired of all the attention being paid to crappy games with predatory business models as well as the gross worship of capital. In response, I forged a few dozen GDC name badges for the CEO of King.com, makers of Candy Crush, and handed them to members of the game dev counter culture.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://twitter.com/starkness" target="_blank">Elizabeth Stark</a>'s birthday party / impromptu friend-conference in 2014, I volunteered to make nametags. Along with the branding and a space to write one's name, there was an algorithmically generated silicon valley corporate title created from a carefully selected corpus.</p>
