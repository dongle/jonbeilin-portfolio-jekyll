	<h1>DIY.org App 2.0 Motion Design</h1>
	<p>When we built the second version of the DIY app, we knew Apple was moving to a flat aesthetic, which meant that the rich, illustrative design of the old app was going to change. Since we couldn't rely on rustic textures and materials to bring warmth to the interface, I wanted to use organic motion to make the app seem like it was breathing.</p>
