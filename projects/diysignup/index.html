<p>At <a href="https://diy.org" target="_blank">DIY.org</a>, an educational community for kids, we faced the challenge of being many of our users' first social network. Our signup completion rates were low. One parent sent us a video of their kid expressing confusion with the account creation screens. Younger kids did not understand why they should create an account, then got lost in the process when they were asked to do things like come up with a password. Moreover, we needed kids to come up with good passwords (that is, not 'password1') to protect their privacy. I wanted to make kids want to finish the signup process, with good names and good passwords.</p>

<p>When I inherited the app, we opened with richly illustrated avatars to choose from. The rest of the signup flow was simple forms on a plain background â€“ that was where kids dropped out. I concepted, storyboarded, and wireframed a richly illustrated, tactile, more game-like account creation process centered around a metaphor of obtaining a membership card to a treehouse. We auto-generated a password to be revealed via a scratch-off on the virtual membership card. The scratch-off was intended to draw attention to the password as an important bit of information (that is, kids couldn't accidentally tap 'next' past it). After this new signup was introduced, our sign-up completion numbers jumped from less than 33% to more than 80%.</p>
