	<h1>DIY.org App 1.X Signup – Design &amp; Engineering</h1>
	<h2>In collaboration with Isaiah Saxon, Zach Klein, and Andrew Sliwinski</h2>
	<p>At <a href="https://diy.org" target="_blank">DIY.org</a>, an educational community for kids, we faced the challenge of being many of our users' first social network. Many users did not understand why they should create an account, then got lost in the process when they were asked to do things like come up with a password. Moreover, we needed kids to come up with good passwords (not password1) to protect their privacy. Our signup completion rates were low. One parent sent us a video of their kid expressing confusion with the account creation screens. When I inherited the app, we had the richly illustrated avatars, but the rest of the signup flow was simple forms on a plain background. I concepted and wireframed a richly illustrated, tactile, more game-like account creation process centered around a metaphor of obtaining a membership card to a treehouse. The scratch-off password reveal was intended to draw attention to the password as an important bit of information. Our sign-up completion numbers jumped from less than 33% to more than 80%.</p>
