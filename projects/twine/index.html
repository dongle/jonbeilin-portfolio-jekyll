    <p>The twine ball is the classic folk-art roadside attraction. Many people have heard of it; only some believe in it; few outside the midwest have witnessed it. Each 17,000+ pound ball of twine has a unique story about its origin and its community: a man binding twine for personal salvation after hearing the voice of God, a ball anchoring a town of 496 people on the map, a man diligently rolling twine until the twine dust gave him emphysema. Plus there are bitter rivalries over who really has the biggest ball.</p>

    <p>This book serves to document and preserve America's four biggest balls of twine as they stand in 2014. As decades long projects, the balls and their contexts change. Some of the balls are over 50 years old. In another 50 years the balls and their surroundings will look very different. The Lake Nebagamon ball may need a new home after its maintainer has passed. The Cawker ball could very well become the most voluminous ball by a factor of two. Or Cawker could become yet another Kansas ghost town. Will Darwin maintain its intentionally quaint aesthetic, or will Minneapolis's revival suburbanize it?</p>
