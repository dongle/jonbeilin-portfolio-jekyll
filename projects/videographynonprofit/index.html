<p>In 2010, I recorded footage and produced a trailer for <a href="http://hackthefuture.org/" target="_blank">Hack The Future</a>, a group of volunteer hands-on educators teaching creative technical skills to silicon valley youth, to show to institutions like Stanford and Microsoft for support. I felt that the video format would be especially valuable to personalize the event, to show the kids working and learning and making self-directed projects. It worked â€“ the group was granted money and access to buildings for future events. It continues to this day.</p>

<p>In 2013, I shot footage for the 2013 <a href="http://amc.alliedmedia.org/" target="_blank">Allied Media Conference</a>, to be compiled into a video summarizing the event to be shown the public and to various stakeholders.</p>
