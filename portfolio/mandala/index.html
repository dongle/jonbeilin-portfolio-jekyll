	<h1>Sri Yantra Mandala â€” 2010</h1>
	<h2>With Rich Vreeland (Disasterpeace)</h2>
	<p>Produced in one weekend as part of <a href="http://www.tigsource.com/2010/08/31/tigjam-3/" target="_blank">TIGJam 3</a>, I wanted to create a touch-driven experience to encompass some of the ritual and physicality along with the temporality of the creation of sand mandalas. Trace the constituent shapes of a mandala one by one then shake the device to erase it. Over 14k downloads and used at home and in temples around the world.</p>

	<p>And now it's open source on <a href="https://github.com/dongle/Yantra-Mandala" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
