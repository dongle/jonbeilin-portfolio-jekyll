	<h1>Nonprofit Videography â€” Ongoing</h1>
	<p>In 2010, I recorded footage and produced a trailer for Hack The Future, a group of volunteer hands-on educators, to show to institutions like Stanford and Microsoft for support (it worked). In 2013, I shot footage for the 2013 Allied Media Conference video.</p>
