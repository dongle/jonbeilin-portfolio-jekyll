  <h3>Skills</h3>
  <p>
    My camera and audio recorder rarely leave my side. I can't bee-ess, but I can write. With only a keyboard, I can use Xcode and git. I can also prototype things in openFrameworks and Processing. I don't know all the shortcuts, but I can make stuff in Illustrator, Lightroom, Premiere, Painter, and Logic Pro, and I can build basic Arduino interfaces. I'm learning Photoshop, Unity, and Cinema 4D.
